                    <h2>Coronavirus (COVID-19)</h2>
                    <p>
                        <span>COVID-19 is a new illness that can affect your lungs and airways.</span>
                        It's caused by a virus called coronavirus. It was discovered in December 2019 in Wuhan, Hubei,
                        China.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Common signs of infection include respiratory symptoms, fever, cough, shortness of breath and
                        breathing difficulties. In more severe cases, infection can cause pneumonia, severe acute
                        respiratory syndrome, kidney failure and even death.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Standard recommendations to prevent infection spread include regular hand washing, covering
                        mouth and nose when coughing and sneezing, thoroughly cooking meat and eggs. Avoid close contact
                        with anyone showing symptoms of respiratory illness such as coughing and sneezing.

                                    Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses. Some cause illness in people, and
                                    others,
                                    such as canine and feline coronaviruses, only infect animals. Rarely, animal
                                    coronaviruses that infect animals have emerged to infect people and can spread
                                    between
                                    people. This is suspected to have occurred for the virus that causes COVID-19.

                                    East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) are

                                    other examples of coronaviruses that originated from animals and then spread to
                                    people.

                                    This virus was first detected in Wuhan City, Hubei Province, China. The first
                                    infections
                                    were linked to a live animal market, but the virus is now spreading from
                                    person-to-person. It’s important to note that person-to-person spread can happen on
                                    a
                                    continuum. Some viruses are highly contagious (like measles), while other viruses
                                    are
                                    less so.

                                    CDC recommends that these patients be isolated either in the hospital or at home
                                    (depending on how sick they are) until they are better and no longer pose a risk of

                                    It is not yet known whether weather and temperature impact the spread of COVID-19.
                                    Some
                                    other viruses, like the common cold and flu, spread more during cold weather months
                                    but
                                    that does not mean it is impossible to become sick with these viruses during other
                                    months. At this time, it is not known whether the spread of COVID-19 will decrease

                                    weather becomes warmer. There is much more to learn about the transmissibility,

                                    the

                                    The most effective ways to protect yourself and others against COVID-19 are to
                                    frequently clean your hands, cover your cough with the bend of elbow or tissue and
                                    maintain a distance of at least 1 meter (3 feet) from people who are coughing or
                                    sneezing. See basic protective measures against the new coronavirus for more

                                    The most common symptoms of COVID-19 are fever, tiredness, and dry cough. Some
                                    patients
                                    may have aches and pains, nasal congestion, runny nose, sore throat or diarrhea.

                                    symptoms are usually mild and begin gradually. Some people become infected but don’t
                                    develop any symptoms and don't feel unwell. Most people (about 80%) recover from the
                                    disease without needing special treatment. Around 1 out of every 6 people who gets
                                    COVID-19 becomes seriously ill and develops difficulty breathing. Older people, and
                                    those with underlying medical problems like high blood pressure, heart problems or
                                    diabetes, are more likely to develop serious illness. People with fever, cough and
                                    difficulty breathing should seek medical attention.

                                    to be a lot of illness in children. Most illness, including serious illness, is
                                    happening in adults of working age and older adults. If there cases of COVID-19 that
                                    impact your child’s school, the school may dismiss students. Keep track of school
                                    dismissals in your community. Read or watch local media sources that report school
                                    dismissals. If schools are dismissed temporarily, use alternative childcare
                                    arrangements, if needed.

                                    associated with food. Before preparing or eating food it is important to always wash
                                    your hands with soap and water for 20 seconds for general food safety. Throughout

                                    against COVID-19 is by frequently cleaning your hands. By doing this you eliminate
                                    viruses that may be on your hands and avoid infection that could occur by then
                                    touching
                                    your eyes, mouth, and nose.
